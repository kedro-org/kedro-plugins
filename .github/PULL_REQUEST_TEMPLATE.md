## Developer Certificate of Origin
We need all contributions to comply with the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). All commits must be signed off by including a `Signed-off-by` line in the commit message. [See our wiki for guidance](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/wiki/Guidelines-for-contributing-developers/).

If your PR is blocked due to unsigned commits, then you must follow the instructions under "Rebase the branch" on the GitHub Checks page for your PR. This will retroactively add the sign-off to all unsigned commits and allow the DCO check to pass.
