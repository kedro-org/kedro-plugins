Enhancing Kedro Documentation: Running SQL Queries with Ibis

Introduction
This contribution seeks to expand the Kedro documentation by integrating tutorials and working examples on how to run SQL queries with Ibis within Kedro projects. Ibis provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for SQL queries, allowing users to work with databases more intuitively while maintaining modular and scalable pipelines. By incorporating Ibis, Kedro users can efficiently execute SQL queries as part of their data workflows without needing to resort to hardcoded SQL or rely on less flexible methods.

Motivation
Many data scientists and engineers working with Kedro need a robust way to handle SQL queries directly within their pipelines. Traditional methods often require manually coding SQL queries or managing queries within the database, which leads to fragmentation and inefficiency. Integrating Ibis with Kedro addresses these challenges by enabling:

Centralized SQL Query Management: With Ibis, users can define SQL queries in Python code, allowing for version control within the Kedro project repository.
Database Engine Flexibility: Ibis supports multiple backends like Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL, and others, providing users the flexibility to switch between databases without changing the SQL syntax.
Performance Optimizations: Ibis supports pushing down SQL operations to the database, which means queries can be executed directly on the backend, optimizing performance and reducing data movement.
Proposed Enhancements
Comprehensive Tutorials

Setting Up Ibis in Kedro:

A detailed, step-by-step guide on installing and configuring Ibis within a Kedro project, ensuring that the integration is seamless for both new and existing projects.
Instructions on configuring the database connection using Ibis, leveraging Kedro’s DataCatalog and KedroContext.
Best practices for connecting to different databases (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, etc.) using Ibis.
Defining SQL Queries Using Ibis Expressions:

Tutorials will cover how to write SQL queries using Ibis expressions in Python, and how these expressions are later translated into actual SQL code.
Examples of basic queries like SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY will be demonstrated through Ibis code.
Ibis functions like ibis.literal, ibis.table, ibis.column will be explained, showing how they map to SQL queries.
Incorporating Ibis Queries into Kedro Pipelines:

Step-by-step walkthroughs on how to structure Kedro pipelines that utilize Ibis queries for data transformations.
Using Kedro’s Node and DataCatalog to integrate Ibis-based queries into each step of a data pipeline.
Code Examples

Integrating Ibis with Kedro’s DataCatalog:

Code snippets will be provided to show how to store Ibis tables and query results in the DataCatalog, allowing for easy retrieval and further processing in Kedro.
Example of setting up an Ibis-based DataSet that interacts with a SQL backend, storing the results of a SQL query as an object in Kedro’s DataCatalog.
SQL Queries for Data Transformation:

Concrete examples will show how SQL queries written in Ibis can be integrated into Kedro pipeline steps for data transformation tasks.
Detailed use cases such as reading data from a SQL database, transforming it using Ibis SQL expressions, and writing the transformed data back to a new table or dataset.
Real-World Use Cases:

Example pipelines will be created to demonstrate how data from various databases (PostgreSQL, BigQuery) can be loaded, transformed using SQL queries with Ibis, and then analyzed or saved to new destinations.

Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Basic Ibis Integration

Create tutorials that introduce Ibis and demonstrate basic query execution within Kedro.
Walkthrough on configuring Ibis within the DataCatalog and writing simple queries.
Establish a baseline of code examples for typical SQL use cases.
Phase 2: Real-World Use Cases and Advanced Integration

Develop more complex pipelines that leverage Ibis queries for tasks such as ETL, data cleaning, and aggregations.
Showcase how Ibis can interact with multiple databases and support flexible backend configurations.
Explore using Ibis with cloud-based SQL engines like Google BigQuery or AWS Redshift.
Phase 3: Publication of Code Examples and Best Practices

Publish the code examples as part of the Kedro documentation.
Add a section dedicated to performance optimization and debugging tips for Ibis queries.
Document and finalize the guidelines for structuring and managing SQL queries within Kedro projects.
Conclusion
Incorporating Ibis for SQL query execution into Kedro's workflow provides an efficient and scalable method for working with databases. With this contribution, users will gain an accessible and Pythonic way to handle SQL queries directly within their Kedro pipelines. By providing in-depth tutorials, clear code examples, and best practices, the Kedro documentation will empower the community to make the most of SQL-powered data processing, improving both the maintainability and performance of their data workflows.
