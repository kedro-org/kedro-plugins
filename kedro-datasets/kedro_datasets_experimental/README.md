# Experimental contributions
This directory is meant for `experimental` dataset contributions. These are datasets that are more experimental compared to the core datasets in `kedro_datasets` and may not fully adhere to the usual standards.
This space allows for the inclusion of datasets that are in the early stages of development or might not meet the criteria for being part of the core Kedro datasets. As such, these datasets
are not maintained by the Kedro TSC, but will have been reviewed to ensure the dataset is usable.

These datasets do not have to be fully documented but must have doc strings that explain the use of the dataset. These datasets donâ€™t run as part of the regular CI/CD jobs.

To contribute an experimental dataset, follow the guidelines in [the datasets contribution guide](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/blob/main/kedro-datasets/CONTRIBUTING.md).
