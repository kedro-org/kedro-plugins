## Code of conduct

The Kedro team pledges to foster and maintain a friendly community. We enforce a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure every Kedroid is welcomed and treated with respect.

## Join the community

You can find the Kedro community on our [Slack organisation](https://slack.kedro.org/), which is where we share news and announcements, and general chat. You're also welcome to post links here to any articles or videos about Kedro that you create, or find, such as how-tos, showcases, demos, blog posts or tutorials.

We also curate a [GitHub repo that lists content created by the Kedro community](https://github.com/kedro-org/awesome-kedro).

## Contribute to the project

There are quite a few ways to contribute to the project, find inspiration from the table below.

|Activity|Description|
|-|-|
|Community Q&A|We encourage you to ask and answer technical questions on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions) or [Slack](https://slack.kedro.org/), but the former is often preferable since it will be picked up by search engines.|
|Report bugs and security vulnerabilities |We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) to keep track of known bugs and security vulnerabilities. We keep a close eye on them and update them when we have an internal fix in progress. Before you report a new issue, do your best to ensure your problem hasn't already been reported. If it has, just leave a comment on the existing issue, rather than create a new one. <br /> If you have already checked the existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) and are still convinced that you have found odd or erroneous behaviour then please file a new one.|
|Propose a new feature|If you have new ideas for Kedro functionality then please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) and describe the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.|
|Review pull requests|Check the [Kedro repo to find open pull requests](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/pulls) and contribute a review!|
|Contribute a fix or feature|If you're interested in contributing fixes to code or documentation, first read our [guidelines for contributing developers](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/contribution/developer_contributor_guidelines.html) for an explanation of how to get set up and the process you'll follow.  Once you are ready to contribute, a good place to start is to take a look at the `good first issues` and `help wanted issues` on [GitHub](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues).|
|Contribute to the documentation|You can help us improve the [Kedro documentation online](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/). Send us feedback as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) or start a documentation discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions).You are also welcome to make a raise a PR with a bug fix or addition to the documentation. First read the guide [Contribute to the Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/contribution/documentation_contributor_guidelines.html).


## Join our Technical Steering Committee

Kedro is an incubating project in [LF AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/), a sub-organisation within the Linux
Foundation that focuses on open innovation within the data and AI space. A group of maintainers, known as the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), govern the project. You can read more about the structure of our TSC in our [Technical Charter](./kedro_technical_charter.pdf).

We invite community members to join the TSC and help define the future of the Kedro project. Read the [guidance on becoming a Kedro maintainer](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/contribution/technical_steering_committee.html) to understand the process of joining the TSC.
