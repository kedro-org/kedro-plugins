# Release 3.0.0
## Major features and improvements

* Added the following new datasets:

| Type                    | Description                                               | Location                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `netcdf.NetCDFDataset`  | A dataset for loading and saving `*.nc` files.            | `kedro_datasets.netcdf` |
| `ibis.TableDataset`     | A dataset for loading and saving using Ibis's backends.   | `kedro_datasets.ibis`   |

* Added support for Python 3.12.
* Normalised optional dependencies names for datasets to follow [PEP 685](https://peps.python.org/pep-0685/). The `.` characters have been replaced with `-` in the optional dependencies names. Note that this might be breaking for some users. For example, users should now install optional dependencies for `pandas.ParquetDataset` from `kedro-datasets` like this:
```bash
pip install kedro-datasets[pandas-parquetdataset]
```
* Removed `setup.py` and move to `pyproject.toml` completely for `kedro-datasets`.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* If using MSSQL, `load_args:params` will be typecasted as tuple.
* Fixed bug with loading datasets from Hugging Face. Now allows passing parameters to the load_dataset function.
* Made `connection_args` argument optional when calling `create_connection()` in `sql_dataset.py`.

# Release 2.0.0
## Major features and improvements

* Added the following new datasets:

| Type                                       | Description                                                                                                                     | Location                     |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `huggingface.HFDataset`                    | A dataset to load Hugging Face datasets using the [datasets](https://pypi.org/project/datasets) library.                        | `kedro_datasets.huggingface` |
| `huggingface.HFTransformerPipelineDataset` | A dataset to load pretrained Hugging Face transformers using the [transformers](https://pypi.org/project/transformers) library. | `kedro_datasets.huggingface` |

* Removed Dataset classes ending with "DataSet", use the "Dataset" spelling instead.
* Removed support for Python 3.7 and 3.8.

# Release 1.8.0
## Major features and improvements

* Added the following new datasets:

| Type                         | Description                                                            | Location                |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `polars.LazyPolarsDataset`   | A `LazyPolarsDataset` using [polars](https://www.pola.rs/)'s Lazy API. | `kedro_datasets.polars` |

* Moved `PartitionedDataSet` and `IncrementalDataSet` from the core Kedro repo to `kedro-datasets` and renamed to `PartitionedDataset` and `IncrementalDataset`.
* Renamed `polars.GenericDataSet` to `polars.EagerPolarsDataset` to better reflect the difference between the two dataset classes.
* Added a deprecation warning when using `polars.GenericDataSet` or `polars.GenericDataset` that these have been renamed to `polars.EagerPolarsDataset`
* Delayed backend connection for `pandas.SQLTableDataset`, `pandas.SQLQueryDataset`, and `snowflake.SnowparkTableDataset`. In practice, this means that a dataset's connection details aren't used (or validated) until the dataset is accessed. On the plus side, the cost of connection isn't incurred regardless of when or whether the dataset is used.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Fixed erroneous warning when using an cloud protocol file path with SparkDataSet on Databricks.
* Updated `PickleDataset` to explicitly mention `cloudpickle` support.

# Release 1.7.0:
## Major features and improvements

* Added the following new datasets:

| Type                      | Description                                                                                                                | Location                |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `polars.GenericDataSet`   | A `GenericDataSet` backed by [polars](https://www.pola.rs/), a lightning fast dataframe package built entirely using Rust. | `kedro_datasets.polars` |

# Release 1.6.0:

## Major features and improvements
* Added support for Python 3.11.

# Release 1.5.3:
## Bug fixes and other changes
* Made `databricks.ManagedTableDataSet` read-only by default.
    * The user needs to specify `write_mode` to allow `save` on the data set.
* Fixed an issue on `api.APIDataSet` where the sent data was doubly converted to json
  string (once by us and once by the `requests` library).
* Fixed problematic `kedro-datasets` optional dependencies, revert to `setup.py`

## Community contributions
# Release 1.5.2:

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Fixed problematic `kedro-datasets` optional dependencies.

# Release 1.5.1:

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Fixed problematic docstrings in `pandas.DeltaTableDataSet` causing Read the Docs builds on Kedro to fail.

# Release 1.5.0

## Major features and improvements

* Added the following new datasets:

| Type                       | Description                          | Location                |
| -------------------------- |--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `pandas.DeltaTableDataSet` | A dataset to work with delta tables. | `kedro_datasets.pandas` |

* Implemented lazy loading of dataset subpackages and classes.
    * Suppose that SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit, is installed in your Python environment. With this change, the SQLAlchemy library will not be loaded (for `pandas.SQLQueryDataSet` or `pandas.SQLTableDataSet`) if you load a different pandas dataset (e.g. `pandas.CSVDataSet`).
* Added automatic inference of file format for `pillow.ImageDataSet` to be passed to `save()`.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Improved error messages for missing dataset dependencies.
    * Suppose that SQLAlchemy, a Python SQL toolkit, is not installed in your Python environment. Previously, `from kedro_datasets.pandas import SQLQueryDataSet` or `from kedro_datasets.pandas import SQLTableDataSet` would result in `ImportError: cannot import name 'SQLTableDataSet' from 'kedro_datasets.pandas'`. Now, the same imports raise the more helpful and intuitive `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'`.

# Release 1.3.0:

## Major features and improvements

* Added the following new datasets:

| Type                             | Description                                             | Location                    |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `databricks.ManagedTableDataSet` | A dataset to access managed delta tables in Databricks. | `kedro_datasets.databricks` |

* Added pandas 2.0 support.
* Added SQLAlchemy 2.0 support (and dropped support for versions below 1.4).
* Added a save method to `APIDataSet`.
* Reduced constructor arguments for `APIDataSet` by replacing most arguments with a single constructor argument `load_args`. This makes it more consistent with other Kedro DataSets and the underlying `requests` API, and automatically enables the full configuration domain: stream, certificates, proxies, and more.
* Relaxed Kedro version pin to `>=0.16`.
* Added `metadata` attribute to all existing datasets. This is ignored by Kedro, but may be consumed by users or external plugins.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Relaxed `delta-spark` upper bound to allow compatibility with Spark 3.1.x and 3.2.x.
* Upgraded required `polars` version to 0.17.
* Renamed `TensorFlowModelDataset` to `TensorFlowModelDataSet` to be consistent with all other plugins in Kedro-Datasets.

# Release 1.0.0:

First official release of Kedro-Datasets.

Datasets are Kedro’s way of dealing with input and output in a data and machine-learning pipeline. [Kedro supports numerous datasets](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/kedro.extras.datasets.html) out of the box to allow you to process different data formats including Pandas, Plotly, Spark and more.

The datasets have always been part of the core Kedro Framework project inside `kedro.extras`. In Kedro `0.19.0`, we will remove datasets from Kedro to reduce breaking changes associated with dataset dependencies. Instead, users will need to use the datasets from the `kedro-datasets` repository instead.

## Major features and improvements
* Changed `pandas.ParquetDataSet` to load data using pandas instead of parquet.

# Release 0.1.0:

The initial release of Kedro-Datasets.
