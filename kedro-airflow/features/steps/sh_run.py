    Args:
        cmd: A command string, or a command followed by program
            arguments that will be submitted to POpen to run.

        split: Flag that splits command to provide as multiple *args
            to Popen. Default is True.

        print_output: If True will print previously captured stdout.
            Default is False.

        kwargs: Extra options to pass to subprocess

    Example:
    ::
        "ls"
        "ls -la"
        "chmod 754 local/file"

    Returns:
        Result with attributes args, returncode, stdout and
        stderr. By default, stdout and stderr are not captured, and those
        attributes will be None. Pass stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE in order
        to capture them.
