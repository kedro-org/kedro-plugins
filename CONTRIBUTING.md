## Code of conduct

The Kedro team pledges to foster and maintain a friendly community. We enforce a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure every Kedroid is welcomed and treated with respect.

## Join the community

You can find the Kedro community on our [Slack organisation](https://slack.kedro.org/), which is where we share news and announcements, and general chat. You're also welcome to post links here to any articles or videos about Kedro that you create, or find, such as how-tos, showcases, demos, blog posts or tutorials.

We also curate a [GitHub repo that lists content created by the Kedro community](https://github.com/kedro-org/awesome-kedro).

## Contribute to the project

There are quite a few ways to contribute to the project. To learn how to do so, you can visit our [Contributing to Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/wiki/Contributing-to-Kedro) guide.

## Join our Technical Steering Committee

Kedro is an incubating project in [LF AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/), a sub-organisation within the Linux
Foundation that focuses on open innovation within the data and AI space. A group of maintainers, known as the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), govern the project. You can read more about the structure of our TSC in our [Technical Charter](./kedro_technical_charter.pdf).

We invite community members to join the TSC and help define the future of the Kedro project. Read the [guidance on becoming a Kedro maintainer](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/contribution/technical_steering_committee.html) to understand the process of joining the TSC.
